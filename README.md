# Release Note
## Beta 2.3.0 (Current)
- Added multithreading support for decryption

### Known Issue
- Only PNG image support
## Beta 2.2.0
- Added multithreading support for image generation resulting in faster encryption & image generation

### Known Issue
- Decryption is not operational
- Only PNG image support

## Beta 2.1.0
- Added multithreading support for encryption
### Known Issue
- Pixel encryption is working fine but problem is in creating image from encrypted pixels. It is the bottleneck.
- Only PNG image support

## Beta 2.0.0
- Added multithreading; but image generation is not proper
### Known Issue
- Threads creation & sharing workload is working fine but image generation & encryption is not proper. It's giving partial output. And giving error on pixel read-write on big image.
- Only PNG image support

## Stable 1.0.0
- Can encrypt & decrypt PNG image
### Known Issue
- Single threaded
- Only PNG image support

# Technologies
- Python
- Python Pillow Library

### Note
In the example above, I used a small image of 32x32 pixels. As it is single threaded(as of now), it takes some time to encrypt & decrypt large images. I am working on it.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python 3.8 or above
3. Install required packages from requirements.txt
4. Run main.py

# Usage
## Encrypting Image
1. Keep the image you want to encrypt in the same directory as main.py
2. Change the name of the image to `image.png`
3. Run main.py
4. Enter the password you want to use to encrypt the image
5. It will generate a file named `encrypt.png`

## Decrypting Image
1. To decrypt the image, run main.py again
2. Enter the password you used to encrypt the image
3. It will generate a file named `decrypt.png`
